If you want to use it efficiently, you need to set `cmd.hqy.life` as your browser's default search engine.

Set this url in browser:
```
https://cmd.hqy.life?q=%s
```
If you fork this repo, and host by yourself, you need to change `cmd.hqy.life` to your own domain. Otherwise, your own scripts in `scripts` folder won't be found.
